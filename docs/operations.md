# Operations runbook

Production is a single Hetzner VPS, `root@zebreus.click`, serving
<https://tenders.zebreus.click>. It runs Ubuntu, not NixOS — the app is built by
the flake and run under a hand-written systemd unit that mirrors
`nix/module.nix`'s hardening flags (ADR-0006). Design context: `CONTEXT.md`.

## Layout on the box

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `/opt/tender-db/repo.git` | bare repo; `git push vps main` from the dev machine lands here |
| `/opt/tender-db/src` | working clone the build runs from |
| `/opt/tender-db/app` | symlink → the live nix store path (atomic switch on deploy) |
| `/opt/tender-db/app-result` | `nix build` result link (the most recently built bundle) |
| `/opt/tender-db/deployed-rev` | git rev of the running deploy |
| `/data/db/tender-db.db` | the Turso database (500 GB volume) |
| `/data/archive/<source>/…` | raw fetched packages, immutable |

`/opt/tender-db/` also holds research artifacts from the exploration phase
(sample packages, SDK checkouts, scan scripts). They are not part of the
deployment; leave them alone.

## Deploy

From a clean checkout on the dev machine:

```sh
./deploy.sh          # deploys main
./deploy.sh <ref>    # deploys any ref
```

The script pushes the ref to the VPS bare repo, builds `#tender-db` **on the
VPS** (it has the 1 Gb/s uplink and the warm nix store — never build the bundle
over the dev machine's ~100 kB/s link), atomically switches `/opt/tender-db/app`,
restarts the service, and health-checks the public URL. A failed build never
touches the symlink, so the old bundle keeps serving.

First build on a cold nix store compiles the whole Rust + wasm toolchain graph
and takes 20–40 minutes on the box's 4 cores. Subsequent deploys reuse the
cached dependency artifacts and take a couple of minutes. If a deploy might
outlive your connection, run it inside tmux on the box.

Rollback: point the symlink at a previous store path and restart.

```sh
ssh root@zebreus.click 'ln -sfnT /nix/store/<old-path> /opt/tender-db/app.new \
  && mv -T /opt/tender-db/app.new /opt/tender-db/app && systemctl restart tender-db'
```

Old store paths survive until `nix store gc` runs; `nix profile`-style
generations are deliberately not used — the symlink is the whole mechanism.

## Service management

```sh
systemctl status tender-db
systemctl restart tender-db
systemctl stop tender-db
systemctl is-enabled tender-db      # enabled → survives reboot
```

Unit: `/etc/systemd/system/tender-db.service`. Runs as the `tenderdb` system
user (not `DynamicUser`, unlike the NixOS module — the data in `/data` must
outlive restarts). `ProtectSystem=strict` with `ReadWritePaths=/data/db
/data/archive`: the process can write nowhere else, so a new state directory
needs a unit edit, not just a `mkdir`. Env is set in the unit
(`IP=127.0.0.1`, `PORT=8080`, `TENDER_DB`, `TENDER_ARCHIVE`).

Anything writing to `/data` outside the service (a manual fetch run, say) must
leave the files owned by `tenderdb`, or the service loses access:

```sh
chown -R tenderdb:tenderdb /data/db /data/archive
```

## Logs

```sh
journalctl -u tender-db -f              # follow
journalctl -u tender-db -n 200          # recent
journalctl -u tender-db --since '1 hour ago'
journalctl -u tender-db -p err          # errors only
```

nginx: `/var/log/nginx/access.log`, `/var/log/nginx/error.log`.

## TLS and nginx

- vhost: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/tenders.zebreus.click` (symlinked into
  `sites-enabled`; the stock `default` site is removed).
- cert: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/tenders.zebreus.click/{fullchain,privkey}.pem`,
  issued by `certbot --nginx`. Renewal is automatic via certbot's systemd timer
  (`systemctl list-timers 'certbot*'`); dry-run it with
  `certbot renew --dry-run`.
- The vhost sets `proxy_buffering off`, `proxy_cache off` and a 24 h read
  timeout so SSE streams flow unbuffered, and enables HTTP/2. Certbot manages
  the `listen 443 ssl` / cert lines; the `http2 on;` line is ours — re-check it
  after any certbot config rewrite.

```sh
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
```

## Disk watch

The DB does not fit the 75 GB root disk — DB and archive both live on the
500 GB volume at `/data`. Watch it, especially during backfill:

```sh
df -h /data /
du -sh /data/db /data/archive
```

Root disk pressure is usually the nix store; reclaim with
`nix store gc` (this deletes unreferenced store paths, including old bundles you
might want for rollback — switch the symlink back first if unsure).

## Backups

There are none, by design. Per `CONTEXT.md`, off-box backups are an accepted
risk for now: everything is rebuildable — canonical data from the raw archive,
the archive from the upstream sources — at a cost of roughly a day. If that
tradeoff changes, the checkpoint+copy runbook (pause writer →
`wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` → file copy, verified with `integrity_check` + row
counts) is in `docs/research/turso-scale.md`. `VACUUM INTO` is forbidden at
scale (OOM).
