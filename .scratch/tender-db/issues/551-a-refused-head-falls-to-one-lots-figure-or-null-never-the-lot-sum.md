# 551 — when the election refuses a head, it falls to one lot's figure (or to null), never to the sum of the lots

Status: needs-triage — filed 2026-10-16 from issue 537's unit-1 synthesis (`.scratch/tender-db/537-lot-sum/
unit1-synthesis-2026-10-16.md`, "What each refused head falls to"). Next: measure how often an elected head is a
single lot's figure while the Tender has two or more lot figures in the same currency, then decide whether the
election may serve a lot sum.
Kind: data quality (amount election: `head_value_eur_cents_with`)
Relates to:
- 537 (decided 2026-10-16): its scale rule refuses 22 heads ≥ €1 bn. 6 fall to null, and 10 fall to ONE lot's
  figure at the right scale, 30–98 % of the true total.
- 471, 492, 505: the other scale rules. A refusal under any of them meets the same fallback.
- 506: partner-only rows (BT-709/BT-660) are never elected and stay out of lot sums.

## Verify

    for t in 7427765 5943121 369057; do curl -s --max-time 20 https://tenders.zebreus.click/v1/tenders/$t | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d['id'], d['value'])"; done

- **done**: after 537's drain, 7427765 serves about €3,000,000 (its six lot awards summed), not one lot's €500,000;
  5943121 serves about €1,321,579.92; 369057 serves €62,378,736.29 or `null` with a recorded reason. OR a
  `## Decision` here keeps the max election, with the reason, and a /docs line says a head can be one lot's figure.
- **open (2026-10-16, before 537's build)**: the three serve their ×1000 heads; 537's unit 3 has not run.

## What was found

`head_value_eur_cents_with` elects the MAXIMUM over the electable procedure-scope and head-lot figures. It never
serves a sum. When a scale rule refuses the procedure figure, the next candidate is whatever single figure is
largest:
- **null** when nothing else is electable. This happens to 369057, 380921, 425446, 392980, 251619 and 706887: their
  only other figures are award rows or partner-only rows.
- **one lot's figure** when the lots carry them. This happens to 7829010 (98 % of the true total), 8514592 (88 %),
  6342034 (71 %), 5779108 (66 %), 6921980 (42 %), 1024214 (35 %), 7044132 (34 %), 5943121 (31 %), 7427765 (1/6)
  and 114991.
- **a wrong figure** when a lot carries its own slip: 867491 falls to LOT-0001's €491.4 m, itself 1000 × its award.

Serving the sum of the lots would give the readers' plausible total for 16 of 537's 22. Serving a single lot
understates every multi-lot Tender. That is better than a ×1000 head, but it is still wrong in every value filter
and sort.

## Proposed units

1. **Measure (S).**
   - In section 16's band and in a bounded sample below it, count the heads that are one lot's figure while the
     head version holds ≥ 2 lot figures in the same currency and no procedure figure.
   - Separately, count the Tenders where every procedure figure is refused or absent.
   - Record how far the lot sum is from the elected figure.
2. **Decide (S).**
   - (a) Serve the per-kind lot sum (awards first, then estimates) when no procedure figure survives, marking the
     head as derived.
   - (b) Keep the max election, and document that a head can be one lot's figure.
   - Mind 506 (partner-only rows never summed), 492's `head_lot_sums` (per-lot maximum across fields), and the SSE /
     change-row surface: a derived head is a new kind of value.
3. **Build (M)** if (a): `head_value_eur_cents_with` plus `refold-value-band` → `project`, pinned on 7427765,
   5943121 and 369057.
